# CodeCasa-Task3

This project uses a dataset from kaggle the [stock market dataset] the whole idea depends on predicting a value for the stock prices later on so i used the xgboostregressor model which is a better model of linear regressor and start to see the accuracy and the mean value error in my predictions and made a plot to see the difference on a graph.
